# Automated-Parking-System
Automated Parking System using Semaphore


This project is aimed to create a
system that helps people with personal vehicles to find for parking easily at selected
areas. The designed system will use the concept of non pre-emptive scheduling
algorithm and semaphores for systematic parking of different types of vehicles. The
proposed system would decrease searching time for vacant spaces for parking and
also reduce the inconvenience. Our project is based on the concept of semaphores and
scheduling. The vehicles enter the parking system in two queues. Only one vehicle
can enter the parking system/machine at a time.
